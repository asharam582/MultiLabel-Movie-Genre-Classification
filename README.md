# Multi-Label Movie Genre Classification

Welcome to the Multi-Label Movie Genre Classification project! This repository contains code and resources for predicting movie genres based on plot summaries. It was developed for the AI Club's hackathon, focusing on multi-label classification tasks.

## Overview

In this project, we explore the unique challenge of predicting multiple genres for movies using machine learning techniques. The dataset consists of plot summaries paired with genre labels, spanning a diverse range of genres including action, comedy, drama, horror, romance, sci-fi, and more.

## Contents

- `data/`: Contains the dataset with plot summaries and genre labels.
- `notebooks/`: Jupyter notebooks for data preprocessing, feature engineering, model training, and evaluation.
- `models/`: Trained models and model evaluation metrics.
- `scripts/`: Utility scripts for data preprocessing and evaluation.
- `requirements.txt`: List of Python dependencies.

## Getting Started

1. Clone this repository:

git clone https://github.com/asharam582/multi-label-movie-genre-classification.git
cd multi-label-movie-genre-classification

2. Install dependencies:

3. pip install -r requirements.txt 
3. Explore the notebooks in the `notebooks/` directory for data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation.

4. Experiment with different models, feature engineering techniques, and hyperparameters to improve performance.

5. Collaborate with the community and share your insights!

## Evaluation

We evaluate model performance using the F1 score, which combines precision and recall for multi-label classification tasks. The goal is to build accurate and efficient classification models capable of predicting movie genres from plot summaries.
